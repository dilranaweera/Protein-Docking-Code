1. Initialize conda environment:

source ~/.bashrc

NOTE: The main directory line thing will have a (base) in front of the user and what work area the user is in along with directories. For example:
(base) [user@thing-systemname directory1] $

2. Next, run conda code:

conda
conda activate /data1/projects/conda/AMDock

NOTE: From here, the main directory line should say: 
(/data1/projects/conda/AMDock) [user@thing-systemname directory1] $

You may have to input these commands:
echo $SHELL
conda init bash

If you need help, you may need to access the vi files:
vi ~kuczera/work/dil/R* 
vi ~kuczera/work/dil/README

You may have to edit the vi file, but check with someone before:
vi ~/.bashrc


3. Run AMDock
