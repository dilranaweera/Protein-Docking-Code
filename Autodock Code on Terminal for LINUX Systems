## Process for Autodock on Vina (on LINUX systems):

1. Find Corresponding Files:


       cd (directory)


2. Locate appropriate ligand and receptor (should be listed within the files available in the folder). Ligands and receptors should both be .pdbqt files.


3. Create a folder with all of the ligands and receptors that are needing to be docked. Shift into the made folder by changing directories after all of the files have been transferred.


4. Input the following code in a terminal line:

5.


    receptor = (arg)                  rigid part of the receptor (PDBQT)
    flex = (arg)                      flexible side chains, if any (PDBQT)
    ligand = (arg)                          ligand (PDBQT)

    center_x = (arg)                              coordinate of the center
    center_y = (arg)                        coordinate of the center
    center_z = (arg)                              coordinate of the center

    size_x = (arg)                    size in the X dimension (Angstroms)
    size_y = (arg)                    size in the Y dimension (Angstroms)
    size_z = (arg)                    size in the Z dimension (Angstroms)

    Exhaustiveness = 32 (May or may not work with this value)


6. Run this code:


 `vina --config (file.name) --log (file.name) &`
